# Person Class

The Person class is a Java program that defines a class for a person's details. It has private instance variables for the person's surname, other names, age, marital status, and gender. It also has methods to display the person's details and to change their marital status.

To use the Person class, create an instance of the class and pass the required parameters to the constructor. The displayDetails() method displays the person's details, while the getMarried(String spname) method changes the person's marital status to 'M' (married) and sets the surname to the spouse's surname if the person is female.
